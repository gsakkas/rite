Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    mulByDigit
with
    mulByDigit; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int -> 'd -> 'e -> 'f
