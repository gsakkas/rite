Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    b
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (wwhile (f, b))
with
    (wwhile [[...]] (f, b))
The actual replacement has type
    'c -> 'c * bool
within context
    let fixpoint (f, b) =
    (wwhile (if f = true then b else (wwhile [[...]] (f, b)), (b; [[...]])))
