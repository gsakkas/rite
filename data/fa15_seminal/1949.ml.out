Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    []
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (bigAdd (mulByDigit h l1) res)
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a
within context
    fun a x -> (let (x1, x2) = x in let (carry, res) = a in (match x2 with
