Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    b
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    b
with
    b; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    ('d -> 'd * bool) -> 'd -> bool
within context
    fun (f, b) ->
      (wwhile ((fun x -> (if ((b; [[...]]) f b) then (b; [[...]]) else (f b))), b))
