This expression has type int but is here used with type int list
Relevant code: (((i * h) / 10) + (mulByDigit i t))

Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    i * h
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    +
with
    +; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int -> int list -> int list
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l = (match (List.rev l) with 
                              | [] -> []
                              | h :: t -> (match (List.length t) with 
                                           | 1 -> (i * h; [[...]])
                                           | _ ->
                                             [(remainder h i)] @
