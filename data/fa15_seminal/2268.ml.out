Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (l mulByDigit ((i - 1) l))
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'e
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l = (if i = 0 then [0] else ((bigAdd; [[...]]) [[...]]))
    ;;
