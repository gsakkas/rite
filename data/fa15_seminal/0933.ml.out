Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    1
with
    1; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'b -> int
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l =
    (if (i <= 1) then l else
      ((bigAdd; [[...]]) l mulByDigit  (i - ((1; [[...]]) l))))
