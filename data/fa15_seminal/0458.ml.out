Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    r
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    iterate
with
    iterate; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int * int -> int
within context
    let isFPoint x = (f x) - x < 0 in
