Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    let args = (List.combine (padZero (l1 l2))) in
      let (_, res) = (List.fold_left f base  args) in res
with
    [[...other program...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'b
within context
    let add (l1, l2) = let f a x = a + x in let base = 0 in [[...other program...]]
      in
      (removeZero (add (padZero l1 l2)))
