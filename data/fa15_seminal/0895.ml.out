Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    sepConcat
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    ""
with
    ""; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (('f -> 'g) -> 'f list -> 'g list) -> 'h -> 'i
within context
    let stringOfList f l = (match l with 
                            | [] -> "[]"
                            | x :: [] -> "[" ^ (x ^ "]")
                            | l ->
                              ((sepConcat; [[...]])
                                  (List.map ""; [[...]] (f l)))) ;;
