Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    sepConcat
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (( ";" ) (List.map (f, l)))
with
    ";"
The actual replacement has type
    string
within context
    let stringOfList f l = (match l with 
                            | [] -> "[]"
                            | x :: [] -> "[" ^ (x ^ "]")
                            | l -> ((sepConcat; [[...]]) ";")) ;;
