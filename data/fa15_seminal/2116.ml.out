Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    sepConcat
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    ";"
with
    ";"; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list) -> 'c -> 'd -> 'e
within context
    fun f l -> "[" ^ (((sepConcat; [[...]]) (( ";"; [[...]] ) List.map f l)) ^ "]")
