This expression has type expr but is here used with type unit
Relevant code: match rand with

    | (3,5) -> buildY ()
    | (6,10) -> buildSine (build (rand, (depth - 1)))
    | (11,18) -> buildCosine (build (rand, (depth - 1)))

Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    (buildY ())

    (buildX ())
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    buildCosine
with
    buildCosine; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
