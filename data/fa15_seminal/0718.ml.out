Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    seen' @ seen
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (List.mem seen'), seen
with
    (List.mem seen'), seen; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    bool
within context
    fun (seen, rest) -> (match rest with 
                         | [] -> seen
                         | h :: t ->
                           (let seen' = h in
                                 let rest' =
                                 (if ((List.mem seen'), seen; [[...]]) then t else
                                   (seen' @ seen; [[...]]))
