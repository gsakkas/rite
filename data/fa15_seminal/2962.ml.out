Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    -
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    1
with
    1; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int list -> 'b
within context
    fun i
      l ->

          (bigAdd l ((mulByDigit i) -; [[...]] ((1; [[...]]) l))))
