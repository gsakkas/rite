Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    mulByDigit
with
    mulByDigit; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int * int -> 'a
within context
    fun i
      l ->
        (if i = 0 then 0 else
          (if i = 1 then l else
            ((bigAdd; [[...]]) l ((mulByDigit; [[...]]) (i - 1, l)))))
