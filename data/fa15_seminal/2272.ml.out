Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    mulByDigit
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    1
with
    1; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int list -> int
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l =
    (if (i >= 0) then (bigAdd l l) else
      ((mulByDigit; [[...]]) (i - ((1; [[...]]) l))))
