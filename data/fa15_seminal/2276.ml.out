Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    mulByDigit
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    i - 1
with
    i - 1; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (int list -> int list -> int list) -> int list -> int list -> 'c
within context
    fun i
      l ->
        (if i = 0 then [0] else
          (if i = 1 then l else
            ((mulByDigit; [[...]]) ((i - 1; [[...]]) bigAdd l  l))))
