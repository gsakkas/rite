Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    recCounter
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (sumList (digitsOfInt n))
with
    (sumList (digitsOfInt n)); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int -> 'c
within context
    let rec recCounter n count =
      (if n < 10 then count else
        ((recCounter; [[...]]) (((sumList (digitsOfInt n)); [[...]]) (count + 1))))
