Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    mod_float
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    ((eval (e1, x, y)) +. (eval (e2, x, y)))
with
    ((eval (e1, x, y)) +. (eval (e2, x, y))); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (expr * float * float -> float) ->
    expr * float * float -> 'c

    let rec eval (e, x, y) = (match e with
