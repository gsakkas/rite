Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    b
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (f b), b
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (('b -> 'b * bool) -> ('b -> 'b * bool) * bool) * ('b -> 'b * bool)
within context
    let fixpoint (f, b) =
    (wwhile (if f = true then b else (wwhile [[...]]), (b; [[...]])))
