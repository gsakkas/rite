Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    i - 1
with
    i - 1; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'd -> 'e
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l =
    (if i = 0 then [] else ((bigAdd; [[...]]) l mulByDigit  ((i - 1; [[...]]) l)))
