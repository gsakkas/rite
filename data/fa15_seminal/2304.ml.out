Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    "sin(pi*" ^ (exprToString e ")")

    "y"

    "x"
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    exprToString
with
    exprToString; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    expr ->
    string ->
    (expr -> string -> string) ->
    expr -> string -> string
within context
    let rec exprToString e = (match e with 
                              | VarX -> ("x"; [[...]])
