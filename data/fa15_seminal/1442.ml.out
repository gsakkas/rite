Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    (buildThresh (x, y, x, y))

    (buildTimes (x, y))

    (buildAverage (x, y))

    y

    x
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    *
with
    *; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (float -> float) -> float -> float
within context
    let rec eval (e, x, y) = (match e with 
                              | VarX -> (x; [[...]])
                              | VarY -> (y; [[...]])
                              | Sine e -> (sin (pi *. (eval (e, x, y))))
                              | Cosine e ->
                                (cos *; [[...]] (pi *. (eval (e, x, y))))

                              | Thresh (e1, e2, e3, e4) ->
                                ((buildThresh (x, y, x, y)); [[...]])) ;;
