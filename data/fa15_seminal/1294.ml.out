Try replacing
    List.fold_left
with
    List.fold_left; [[...]]
of type
    (int -> int -> int * int) -> int * int -> 'a * 'b -> 'c * 'd
within context
    let f a x = a + x, a + x in
      let base = 0, 0 in
      let args = l1, l2 in
      let (_, res) = ((List.fold_left; [[...]]) f base  args) in res
