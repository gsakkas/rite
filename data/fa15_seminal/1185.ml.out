Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    exprToString
with
    exprToString; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    expr ->
    string ->
    (expr -> string) -> expr -> string
within context
    let rec exprToString e = (match e with 
                              | VarX -> "x"
                              | VarY -> "y"
