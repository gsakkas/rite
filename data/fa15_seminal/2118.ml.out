Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    sepConcat
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    ";"
with
    ";"; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a list -> 'b
within context
    fun f
      l -> "[" ^ (((sepConcat; [[...]]) (( ";"; [[...]] ) (List.map f l))) ^ "]")
