Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    mod
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    10
with
    10; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (bool -> bool) -> int -> 'c
within context
    let rec count acc n =
      (if ((mod; [[...]]) (sumList (digits n)) ((10; [[...]]) not 0)) then acc else
        acc + 1)
      in
      (count 1 n)
