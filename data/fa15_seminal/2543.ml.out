Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (mulByDigit (x l1) 10) ** a1
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a
within context
    let f a x = let (a1, a2) = a in ((bigAdd; [[...]]) a2 [[...]]) in
      let base = 0, [] in
      let args = (List.rev l1) in
      let (_, res) = (List.fold_left f base  args) in res
