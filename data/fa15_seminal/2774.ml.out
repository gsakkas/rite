Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (mulByDigit i) - (1 l)
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'c -> 'd
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l = (match i with 
                              | 0 -> []
                              | _ -> ((bigAdd; [[...]]) ([[...]] l))) ;;
