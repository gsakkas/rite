Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    (mod n 10)
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (digitsOfInt (n / 10)) :: (mod n 10)
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'b list
within context
    let rec digitsOfInt n = (match n < 0 with 
                             | true -> []
                             | false ->
                               (if n / 10 = 0 then ((mod n 10); [[...]]) else
                                   [[...]])) ;;
