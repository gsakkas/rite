Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    @
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    @
with
    @; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    string -> string -> 'b
within context
    let rec exprToString e = (match e with 
                              | VarX -> "x"
                              | VarY -> "y"
