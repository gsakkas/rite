Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    /
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    return
with
    return; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (int -> int list) -> int -> 'a
within context
    fun n ->
      (let return = [] in
          (if n < 0 then return else
              (mod n 10) :: (((return; [[...]]) digitsOfInt n) /; [[...]] 10)))
