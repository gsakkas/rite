Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    buildCosine
with
    buildCosine; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    ((int * int -> int) * int -> unit -> expr) ->
    int * int -> unit -> expr
within context
    let rec build (rand, depth) =
    (if depth > 0 then (let rand' = (rand (1, 5)) in (match rand' with
