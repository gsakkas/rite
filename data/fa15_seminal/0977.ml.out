Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    0
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    String.concat
with
    String.concat; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    string * string * string -> string
within context
    let rec exprToString e = (match e with 
                              | VarX -> "x"
