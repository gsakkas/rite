Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    /
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    [(mod n 10)]
with
    [(mod n 10)]; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (int -> 'd list) -> int -> 'e
within context
    let rec digitsOfInt n =
    (if n < 0 then [] else
      [] @ ((digitsOfInt [(mod n 10)]; [[...]] n) /; [[...]] 10))
    ;;
