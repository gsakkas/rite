Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    h * i
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    remainder
with
    remainder; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int -> int list -> 'a list
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l = (match (List.rev l) with 
                              | [] -> []
                              | h :: t ->
                                (if (List.length t) = 0 then (h * i; [[...]]) else
                                    ((remainder; [[...]]) h y)
                                      @ (mulByDigit i t))) ;;
