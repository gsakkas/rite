Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    mod
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    append
with
    append; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (int -> int list) -> int -> int -> 'a
within context
    let rec digitsOfInt n =
    (if (n <= 0) then [n] else
      ((mod; [[...]]) ((append; [[...]]) digitsOfInt (n / 10)  n) 10))
    ;;
