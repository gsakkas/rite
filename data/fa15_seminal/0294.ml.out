Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    l1, l2
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    -
with
    -; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int list -> int -> int list
within context
    fun l1
      l2 ->
        (let diff = (List.length l1) - (List.length l2) in
            (if diff < 0 then l1 @ (clone 0 (-1 * diff - 1)) else
                (if diff > 0 then l2 @ ((clone 0 diff) -; [[...]] 1) else
                  (l1, l2; [[...]]))))
