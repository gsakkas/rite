Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    rest = t
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    seen'
with
    seen'; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    ('b list * 'b list -> 'b list) -> 'c list * 'b list -> 'b list
within context
    fun (seen, rest) -> (match rest with 
                         | [] -> seen
                         | h :: t ->
                           (let seen' = [] in
                                 let rest' = (List.rev t) in
                                 (if (List.mem h rest') then (rest = t; [[...]])
                                     else
                                     h ::
                                         ((seen'; [[...]]) helper (seen', rest')))))
