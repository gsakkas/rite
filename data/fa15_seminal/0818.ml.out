Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    fun i ->
      (if x < 10 then i else
        (let x' = (sumList (digitsOfInt x)) in
            (if x' > 9 then 1 + (itt x' i) else 1)))
with
    fun i -> [[...other program...]]; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a
