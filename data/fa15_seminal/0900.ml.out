Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    (explode w)
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    0
with
    0; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    string -> int
within context
    let palindrome w =
    (if String.length = (0; [[...]]) then true else ((explode w); [[...]]))
