Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (mulByDigit x l2)
with
    (mulByDigit x l2); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'i -> 'j
within context
    let f a x = 0, ((bigAdd; [[...]]) (((mulByDigit x l2); [[...]]) a)) in
      let base = 0, [0] in
      let args = l1 in let (_, res) = (List.fold_left f base  args) in res
