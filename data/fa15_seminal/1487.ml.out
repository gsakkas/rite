Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    b
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    f
with
    f; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    ('c -> 'c * bool) * 'c -> 'c -> 'c * bool
within context
    let fixpoint (f, b) =
    (wwhile (if f = true then b else ((f; [[...]]) b), (b; [[...]])))
