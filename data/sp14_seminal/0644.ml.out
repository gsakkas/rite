Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    mulByDigit
with
    mulByDigit; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'b -> 'c -> 'c -> 'd
within context
    let f a x = (match x with 
                 | [] -> a
                 | h :: t ->
                   ((bigAdd; [[...]])
                       (((mulByDigit; [[...]]) h a)
