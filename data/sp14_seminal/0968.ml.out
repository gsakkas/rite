Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    -
with
    -; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int list -> int list -> int
within context
    fun l1
      l2 ->
        (let len1 = (List.length l1) in
            let len2 = (List.length l2) in
            (if l1 < l2 then (List.append (clone 0 (l2 -; [[...]] l1)) l1), l2 else
                [[...other program...]]))
