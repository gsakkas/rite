Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    input
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (loop (input / 10))
with
    (loop (input / 10)); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int
within context
    fun n ->
      (if (mod n 2) = 0 && n > 0 then
        (let rec loop input =
            (if input < 10 then (input; [[...]]) else
              [(loop (input / 10)); [[...]] ; (mod input 10)])
