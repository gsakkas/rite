Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    List.map
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    "; "
with
    "; "; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a -> 'b
within context
    fun f l -> "[" ^ (((List.map; [[...]]) f (( "; "; [[...]] ) l)) ^ "]")
