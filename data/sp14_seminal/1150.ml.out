Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    n
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (digitsOfInt (n / 10))
with
    (digitsOfInt (n / 10)); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int
within context
    let rec digitsOfInt n =
    (if n < 0 then [] else
      (if n < 10 then (n; [[...]]) else
        [(digitsOfInt (n / 10)); [[...]] ; (mod n 10)]))
