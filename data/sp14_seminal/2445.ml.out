Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (List.append (((clone 0 l2G) l1), l2))
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'g list * 'h list
within context
    let padZero l1 l2 =
    (if (List.length l1) > (List.length l2) then [[...other program...]] else
      (if (List.length l1) < (List.length l2) then
