Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    /
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    +
with
    +; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    float -> float -> 'a

    let rec eval (e, x, y) = (match e with
