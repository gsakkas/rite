Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    1, (i + j) - 10
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (if (i + j <= 9) then 0, i + j)
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a
within context
    let f a x =
      let (i, j) = x in (if i + j > 9 then (1, (i + j) - 10; [[...]]) else [[...]])
      in
      let base = 0, [] in
      let args = (List.combine (List.rev l1) (List.rev l2)) in
      let (_, res) = (List.fold_left f base  args) in res
