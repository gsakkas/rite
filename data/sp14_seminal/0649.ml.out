Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    a'
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (bigAdd ((mulByDigit (h, l1')) a'))
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'c

    let f a x = let (l1', a') = a in (match x with
