This function is applied to too many arguments,
maybe you forgot a `;'
Relevant code: sumList

Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    1 + (additivePersistence sumList n)

    0
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    sumList
with
    sumList; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (int -> int list) -> (int list -> int) -> int
within context
    let rec additivePersistence n =
    (if ((sumList; [[...]]) digitsOfInt n) < 9 then (0; [[...]]) else
      (1 + (additivePersistence sumList n); [[...]]))
    ;;
