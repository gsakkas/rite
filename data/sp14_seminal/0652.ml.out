Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    a'
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    bigAdd
with
    bigAdd; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (int list -> int list) -> 'a -> 'b
within context
    let f a x = let (l1', a') = a in (match x with 
                                      | [] -> (a'; [[...]])
                                      | h :: t ->
                                        ((bigAdd; [[...]])
