This expression should not be a function, the expected type is
('a -> 'a * bool) * 'a
Relevant code: (fun y  -> let x = f b in if x = b then ((x, true), b))

Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    fun y -> (let x = (f b) in (if x = b then (x, true), b))
with
    fun y -> (let x = [[...other program...]] in [[...other program...]]); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    ('b -> 'b * bool) * 'b
within context
    let fixpoint (f, b) =
    (wwhile
      (fun y -> (let x = [[...other program...]] in [[...other program...]]);
        [[...]]))
