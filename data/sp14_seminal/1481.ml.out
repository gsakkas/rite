Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    0
with
    0; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a list
within context
    fun a x -> (match x with
