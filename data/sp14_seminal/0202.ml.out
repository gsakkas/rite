Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    +
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    1
with
    1; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    ('b list -> 'c list) -> 'b list -> 'd
within context
    let rec sumList xs = (match xs with 
                          | [] -> []
