Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    *
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    *
with
    *; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'g list -> int -> 'h -> 'i
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l = (match (List.rev l) with
