Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    /.
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    ((eval (expr x y)) +. (eval (expr1 x y)))
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'b5
within context
    let rec eval (e, x, y) = (match e with
