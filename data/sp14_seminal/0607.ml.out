Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    fun c ->
      (let (s, t) = x in
          let sum = (c + s) + t in (List.split sum / 10 :: (mod sum 10) :: a))
with
    fun c ->
      (let (s, t) = [[...other program...]] in
          let sum = [[...other program...]] in [[...other program...]]);
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'c
