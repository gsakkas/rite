Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    sepConcat
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    sep
with
    sep; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    string list -> 'a
within context
    fun a x -> h ^ (sep ^ ((sepConcat; [[...]]) ((sep; [[...]]) t)))
