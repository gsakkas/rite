Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    removeZero
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (mod (h1 + h2) 10)
with
    (mod (h1 + h2) 10); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int list
