Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (bigAdd l l)
with
    (bigAdd l l); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int list -> 'd
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l = (match i with
