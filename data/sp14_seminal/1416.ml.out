This pattern matches values of type 'a list
but is here used to match values of type int
Relevant code: h::t

Try replacing
    (match n with 
     | 0 -> [0]
     | h :: t -> [] @ (h @ (digitsOfInt t)))
with
    (match n with 
     | 0 -> [0]
     | _ -> [[...]])
of type

Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    h :: t
with
    _
The actual replacement has type
    'b list
within context
    let rec digitsOfInt n = (if n < 0 then [] else (match n with 
                                                    | 0 -> [[...other program...]]
