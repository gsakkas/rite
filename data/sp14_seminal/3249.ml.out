Try replacing
    List.rev
with
    base
of type
    ('f list -> 'g list -> ('f * 'g) list) -> 'h -> 'i -> 'j
within context
    fun (l1, l2) ->
      (let f a x = let carry = x in carry in
          let base = (failwith "to be implemented") in
          let args = (base List.combine l1  l2) in
          let (_, res) = (List.fold_left f base  args) in res)
