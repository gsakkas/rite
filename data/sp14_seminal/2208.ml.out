Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (bigAdd l l)
with
    (bigAdd l l); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int list -> 'e
within context
    fun i
      l ->
        (if i = 0 then [] else
          (if i = 1 then l else
            ((bigAdd; [[...]]) (((bigAdd l l); [[...]]) (mulByDigit (i - 2) l)))))
