Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    =
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    1
with
    1; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    (int -> int) -> int -> int
within context
    let rec additivePersistence n =
    let count = 0 in
      (if (List.length (digitsOfInt n)) = 1 then count else
          (count =; [[...]]
              count + ((1; [[...]]) additivePersistence (addList (digitsOfInt n)))))
