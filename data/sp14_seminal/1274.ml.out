Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    additivePersistence
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (sumList (digitsOfInt n))
with
    [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int -> 'b
within context
    let rec additivePersistence n count = (match n with 
                                           | [] -> count
                                           | _ ->
