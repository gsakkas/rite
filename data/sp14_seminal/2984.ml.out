Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    app
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    [n / 10]
with
    [n / 10]; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int list -> 'a

    let rec digitsOfInt n =
