Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    bigAdd
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    bigAdd
with
    bigAdd; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    int -> int -> 'a list -> 'b
within context
    let rec mulByDigit i l = (match i with 
                              | 0 -> []
                              | 1 -> l
                              | _ ->
                                ((bigAdd; [[...]])
                                    (((bigAdd; [[...]]) 1 1)
