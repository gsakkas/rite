This expression should not be a function, the expected type is
('a -> 'a * bool) * 'a
Relevant code: (fun x  -> if (f x) = x then (b, false) else (((f x), true), b))

Your code has several type errors.  If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    fun x -> (if (f x) = x then b, false else ((f x), true), b)
with
    fun x -> [[...other program...]]; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    ('b -> 'b * bool) * 'b
within context
    let fixpoint (f, b) = (wwhile (fun x -> [[...other program...]]; [[...]])) ;;
