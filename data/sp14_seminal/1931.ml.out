Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    f
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    f
with
    f; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a -> 'a
within context
    fun (f, b) ->
      (if b != (f b) then
        (let f = f, true in (wwhile ((f; [[...]]), ((f; [[...]]) b))))
        else
        b)
