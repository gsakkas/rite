Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    c :: s
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    s
with
    s; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    bool
within context
    fun a
      x ->
        (let (x', x'') = x in
            let (c, s) = a in
            (if (s; [[...]]) then (c :: s; [[...]]) else
                ((c + x') + x'') / 10, (mod ((c + x') + x'') 10) :: s))
