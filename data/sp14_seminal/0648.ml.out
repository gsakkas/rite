Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    a'
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    (bigAdd ((mulByDigit (h l1')) a'))
with
    (bigAdd ((mulByDigit (h l1')) a')); [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'a
within context
    let f a x = let (l1', a') = a in (match x with 
                                      | [] -> (a'; [[...]])
                                      | h :: t ->
                                        ((bigAdd ((mulByDigit (h l1')) a'));

      let (_, res) = (List.fold_left f base  args) in res
