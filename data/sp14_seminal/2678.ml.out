Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    List.mem
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    h
with
    h; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'c list -> 'd
within context
    fun (seen, rest) -> (match rest with
