Your code has several type errors.  The following subexpressions are type-correct on their own, but do not fit with the rest of the program:
    sumList
If you ignore other surrounding code, try replacing
    digitsOfInt
with
    digitsOfInt; [[...]]
The actual replacement has type
    'd list -> 'e
