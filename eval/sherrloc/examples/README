This folder contains several examples that demonstrate the usage of the
SHErrLoc tool.

---------------------
Example 1:  prog1.ml prog1.con

prog1.ml is a simplified OCaml program written by a student working on a
programming assignment. prog1.con contains a set of constraints describing the
OCaml type inferrence for prog1.ml. prog1.con is generated by the EasyOCaml++
tool released separately at
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/sherrloc/EasyOCaml++.tar.gz

To diagnose the most likely wrong expression in prog1.ml, run the following
command:

sherrloc -e prog1.con

The SHErrLoc tool also generates richer HTML reports. To do that, run the
following command:

sherrloc -e -w -s prog1.ml -o prog1.html prog1.con

The SHErroLoc tool generates prog1.html as the error report. You may need the
scripts and style files in $HOME/HTML to take the full advantage of the HTML
report.


---------------------
Example 2:  prog2.jif prog2.con

prog2.jif is a simplified Jif program written by a Jif programmer working on a
project with real-world security concern. prog2.con contains a set of
constraints describing the Jif label checking for prog2.jif. prog2.con is
generated by a Jif extension that is currently not released yet.

To diagnose the most likely wrong expression in prog2.jif, run the following
command:

sherrloc -e prog2.con

Similar to prog1, the following command generates a report in HTML format:

sherrloc -e -w -s prog2.jif -o prog2.html prog2.con


---------------------
Example 3:  prog3.jif prog3.con

prog3.jif is a Jif program from a Jif example in the Jif compiler release
except that a hypothesis "AirlineA <= airlines" is removed at line 31.
prog3.con contains a set of constraints describing the Jif label checking for
prog3.jif.

To diagnose the most likely missing hypothesis in prog3.jif, run the following
command:

sherrloc -h prog3.con
