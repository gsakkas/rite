As of Feb 4th 2000, the native-code compiler for the Motorola 680x0 is
no longer maintained and thus deprecated.

The only machines on which we could test this port (Sun 3, SunOS 4)
here at INRIA are being retired, and were so slow that the port wasn't
kept up-to-date with the remainder of the system.
