Some examples for LablTk.
They are written in classic mode, except testris.ml which uses label
commutation.
You may either compile them here, or just run them as scripts with
        labltk example.ml

hello.ml        A very simple example of CamlTk
hello.tcl       The same programme in Tcl/Tk

demo.ml         A demonstration using many widget classes

eyes.ml         A "bind" test

calc.ml         A little calculator

clock.ml        An analog clock  (uses unix.cma)

tetris.ml       You NEED a game also (uses -labels)
