This software release generates constraints according to the constraint
language described in the paper "Toward general diagnosis of static errors" by
Danfeng Zhang and Andrew C. Myers. This implementation is based on EasyOCaml,
an extension to the OCaml compiler.

To install and run the modified OCaml compiler, please follow the instructions
in README.easyocaml.

To generate constraint file, use the executables "ecaml" or "ecamlc" in the
"bin" directory. The following option is added to the standard OCaml
command-line interface to enable interprocedural type inferrence:

-inter:  Enable interprocedural type inferrence

The compilation generates a constraint file (error.con) when type inference
fails. This constraint file can then be fed into the general error diagnostic
tool, ShErrLoc (available at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/sherrloc/), to
find the most likely cause of the type errors.
