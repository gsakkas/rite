\section{Predicting Repair Templates}
\label{sec:templ-pred}

In this section, we extend our API from \autoref{sec:localization}, so we are
able to predict repair templates $\T$ for a given location of the program. Our
goal is to define the $\evalsym$ function in \autoref{fig:api}, in terms of the
simple language \repairLang (\autoref{fig:syntax}), which takes a $\ModelT$ and
a feature vector $\V$ of a specific subexpression as an input and produces a
confidence score $\C$ for each of the chosen templates $\T$. Any given template
$\T$ is an expression $e$ of the \repairLang, which a simple lambda calculus
with integers, booleans, pairs, and lists.

Firstly, a $\ModelT$ is produced by $\trainTsym$, which performs supervised
learning on a training set of feature vectors $\V$ and a fixed-length of
(boolean) labels $\B$, that each represent a template $\T$. In our case, only
one template can be applied to a given location, so we define here our problem
as a \emph{multi-class classification} problem. Once trained, we can make
predictions on new inputs, producing template confidences $\Runit$ for each
template $\T$.

Similarly to \autoref{sec:localization}, our $\ModelT$s expect feature vectors
$\V$ and boolean labels $\B$, both of a fixed length for each specific location.
Therefore, we define similarly to $\extractsym$, the function $\extractTsym$ in
\autoref{fig:api}. We use again $\diffsym$ to get the set of changed expressions
of a given program pair. Those are then used by the function $\clustersym$ to
get the repair templates by grouping different expressions together based on
some similarity metric and thus reducing their number and making them more
concrete. The $\extractTsym$ function, then, extracts $\featuresym$ from each
subexpression, acquired by $\diffsym$ but limited to the type-error slice (TODO:
ref) and assigns the boolean labels based on the templates $\T$ according to
$\clustersym$, with only one being $\etrue$ at a time
