\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}


We begin with an overview of our approach to suggesting fixes for various faulty
programs by collectively learning from the processes novice programmers take to
fix errors in their programs.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{ecode}
      let rec mulByDigit i l =
        match l with
        | []     -> []
        | hd::tl -> (hd * i) @ (mulByDigit i tl)
    \end{ecode}

    \begin{ecode}
      let rec mulByDigit i l =
        match l with
        | []     -> []
        | hd::tl -> [hd * i] @ (mulByDigit i tl)
    \end{ecode}
    \caption{(top) An ill-typed \ocaml program that should multiply each element
    of a list with an integer. (bottom) The fixed version by the student.}
    \label{fig:mulByDigit}
\end{figure}


\mypara{The Problem.} Consider the \texttt{mulByDigit} program in
\autoref{fig:mulByDigit} written by a student in an undergraduate Programming
Languages course. The program is meant to multiply all the numbers in a list
with an integer digit, but the student accidentally misuses the list append
operator (\texttt{@}), applying it to a number and a list rather than two lists.
Novice programmers may not find the compiler's resulting type checking error
message informative.  In this particular instance, the student chose the
approach shown in \autoref{fig:mulByDigit}, but multiple solutions are possible,
including using the \texttt{::} operator to prepend a single element onto a
list. We desire an automated technique to guide novice programmers by suggesting
candidate solutions.

\mypara{Solution. Suggesting Repairs via Supervised Classification and Program
Synthesis.} Our approach is to view the process of \emph{fixing} an erroneous
program as a \emph{supervised multi-class classification problem}, whose results
are then fed to a \emph{program synthesizer}. A classification problem entails
learning a function that maps inputs to a discrete set of output labels (in
contrast to techniques such as regression, where the output is typically a real
number). A supervised learning problem is one in with an available training set
where the inputs and labels are known, and the task is to learn a function that
accurately maps the inputs to output labels and generalizes to future inputs. To
realize the above approach for suggesting good possible repairs as a practical
tool, we structure our solution into five sub-problems:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How can we acquire a training set of labeled ill-typed programs with
  their respective user-provided fixes?
  \item How can we represent possible solutions to a defect?
  \item What are the appropriate models to represent this problem?
  \item How can we use predictive models to repair faulty programs?
  \item How can we use predictive models and synthesized repairs to give
  localized feedback to the programmer?
\end{enumerate}

In the remainder of this section, we consider each sub-problem in turn.

\subsection{Step 1: Acquiring a Blame-Labeled Training Set}
\label{subsec:step1}

The first step is to gather a training set of ill-typed programs, where each
erroneous sub-term is explicitly labeled. Prior work has often enlisted expert
users to curate a set of ill-typed programs and then \emph{manually} determine
the correct fix~\citep[\eg][]{Lerner2007-dt, Loncaric2016-uk}. This method is
suitable for evaluating the quality of a localization (or repair) algorithm on a
small number (e.g. 10s--100s) of programs. However, in general it requires a
great deal of effort for the expert to divine the original programmer's
intentions. Consequently, is difficult to scale the expert-labeling to yield a
dataset large enough (e.g. 1000s of programs) to facilitate machine learning.
More importantly, this approach fails to capture the frequency with which errors
occur in practice.

\mypara{Interaction Traces.} We solve both the scale and frequency problems by
instead extracting blame-labeled data sets from \emph{interaction traces}.
Software development is an iterative process. Programmers, perhaps after a
lengthy (and sometimes frustrating) back-and-forth with the type checker,
eventually end up fixing their own programs. Previous work has used an
instrumented \ocaml compiler to record this conversation, i.e. record the
sequence of programs submitted by each programmer and whether or not it was
deemed type-correct. For each ill-typed program in a particular programmer's
trace, they find the first subsequent program in the trace that type checks and
declare it to be the fixed version. In our case, we used an existing extracted
dataset~\citep[][]{yunounderstand, Seidel:2017} of ill-typed programs and their
fixes. From these pairs, we can extract a \emph{diff} of the abstract syntax
trees (ASTs), and then assign the blame labels to the \emph{smallest} sub-tree
in the diff.

\mypara{Example.} Suppose our student fixed the \texttt{mulByDigit} program as
shown above by adding a \texttt{[]} around the result of the multiplication, the
diff would include the list expression. Thus we would determine that the list
expression is the repair we have to blame.

\mypara{Bags-of-Abstracted-Terms.} Our representation of programs is
parameterized by a set of feature abstraction functions, (abbreviated to feature
abstractions) $f_1, \ldots, f_n$ , that map terms to a numeric value (or just
$\{0, 1\}$ to encode a boolean property). Given a set of feature abstractions,
we can represent a single program's AST as a \emph{bag-of-abstracted-terms}
(BOAT) by:
%
(1) decomposing the AST (term) $t$ into a bag of its constituent sub-trees
(terms) $\{t_1, \ldots, t_m\}$; and then
%
(2) representing each sub-term $t_i$ with the $n$-dimensional vector $[f_1(t_i),
\ldots, f_n(t_i)]$. Working with ASTs is a natural choice as type-checkers
operate on the same representation.

\mypara{Modeling Contexts.} Each expression occurs in some surrounding
\emph{context}, and we would like the classifier to be able make decisions based
on the context as well. The context is particularly important for our task as
each expression imposes typing constraints on its neighbors. For example, a |@|
operator tells the type checker that both children must have type |'a list| and
that the parent must accept an |'a list|. The BOAT representation makes it easy
to incorporate contexts: we simply \emph{concatenate} each termâ€™s feature vector
with the \emph{contextual features} of its parent and children.

\mypara{Type features.} Another way to summarize the context in which an
expression occurs is with types. Of course, the programs we are given are
untypeable, but we can still extract a partial typing derivation from the type
checker and use it to provide more information to the model. However, to help
later our classifier give better predictions of the possible fixes, we want
those types to be as close as possible to the types that correct program would
have or at least be a super-type of them. To achieve that, we replace each time
one location of the program with a typed hole and extend the type checker to
infer the type of that hole from the context of the program. This procedure
would give more accurate super-types than getting partial typing derivation from
the untypeable original program.



\subsection{Step 2: Representing fixes as labels}
\label{subsec:step2}

Next, we represent different fixes via a limited number of templates. We focus
on AST-level templates that are easy for novices to understand.

\mypara{Clustering the Fixes.} Our dataset contains erroneous programs and the
corresponding user-written fixes. Those fixes can be arbitrary code
modifications with different lengths, variable names, functions, and so on. We
propose to automatically cluster such fixes into abstract fix schema. This
clustering serves two purposes. First, it enables the subsequent use of discrete
classification algorithms to choose. Second, it allows for the principled
removal of outliers. Outliers are a relevant problem because student datasets
often contain non-standard or idiosyncratic solutions. We propose to use a
simple clustering algorithm applied atop a similarity metric for fixes.
%
% FIXME: The original text had \emph{equivalent} here. Do you actually mean
% that? If so, be more precise. The text also talked about outlier removal,
% so I made that more formal --- but is it something we're actually doing?

\mypara{Generic Abstract Syntax Trees.}
Fixes in our dataset are represented as the ASTs of the expressions that changed
in the ill-typed programs and transformed the program to the correct solution.
To enable \emph{similar fixes} in different ill-typed programs to be clustered
together and thus get a smaller number of clusters of better quality, we propose
a further simplification of the changed ASTs: the Generic Abstract Trees
(GASTs). GASTs are taken from their respective ASTs, with all the specific
variable, function, operator and etc. names removed from them. These trees keep
information only about the \emph{structure} of the fix rather than the specific
changes in variables and functions. We also prune these GASTs at a certain depth
$d$ to keep only the top-level changes of the fix. Pruned sub-trees are replaced
with \emph{holes}, which represent that \emph{any expression} is possible to
fill them.

% TODO: Make figure of GAST for running example.
% The ASTs of the fixes is a good start, but those still contain too much
% information. See our running example. |[hd * i]| is a list that includes a
% multiplication of the variables |hd| and |i|. While we care about the list and
% the binary operator, all the rest information is not that important. T

\mypara{Fix Templates.} Previous work~\citep[][]{martinez2013automatically,
martinez2015mining} has used \emph{fix templates} to generate \emph{patches}
that can be used to repair an erroneous program. Those templates are usually
picked manually by inspecting a large corpus of buggy programs and their fixes.
However, we show that such fix templates can be \emph{learned} from those
datasets using the clusters of fixes' GASTs. A GAST representative of a cluster
can be used as a fix template in order to produce a fix or provide feedback for
the type-error that a faulty program raises.

% TODO: Show template for running example.
% For our example, the GAST would be a list with a binary operator as a child,
% whose children in return would be holes, if we were to prune GASTs at a depth $d
% = 2$. The binary operator would also be unknown at this point, thus creating a
% template of the form |[_ # _]|. We see in \autoref{fig:suggestion} how that
% template would work to provide feedback to programmers, but we discuss later how
% we can complete the template with program synthesis.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{ecode}
    let rec mulByDigit i l =
      match l with
      | []     -> []
      | hd::tl -> [_ # _] @ (mulByDigit i tl)
  \end{ecode}
  \caption{A possible template for the \texttt{mulByDigit} program.}
  \label{fig:suggestion}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Step 3: Training Predictive Models}
\label{subsec:step3}

Now we have a minimal set of fix templates that we want to predict from. We
enumerate our templates, starting from 1, and update the dataset to have as
labels the number of the template that \emph{fixes} that location of the
program. We can now train a classifier that predicts fix templates given a
ill-typed program. Because we still have multiple templates (\emph{classes}) to
choose from, we have a multi-class problem in our hands, as opposed to the more
common binary classification. We will treat error localization as binary
classification problem.

\mypara{Error Localization.} Previous work has shown to give excellent accuracy
on localizing type-errors using program analytics techniques. In order to reduce
the complexity of predicting the correct template and the location that it
should be applied from our multi-class classifier, we separate those two
problems. We use a second DNN classifier to associate locations with their
probability to be fixed. Then, starting from the locations with the highest
probabilities to be fixed, we try to repair them using the template predictions
for those particular locations.

\mypara{Multi-class Classification.} We choose models that can handle multiple
classes as labels. Such models are Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). But those models
produce not only a predicted template-class, but they also associate a metric
that can be interpreted as the classifierâ€™s confidence in its prediction. We use
deep and dense architectures to give a better confidence to each template, with
more accuracy.



\subsection{Step 4: Program Repair}
\label{subsec:step4}

After making template predictions and error localization for ill-typed programs,
we exploit existing program synthesis techniques to fill holes and generic
expressions that our templates have and return programs that type-check. This
way, we can also eliminate templates that wouldnâ€™t actually work for a
particular location.

\mypara{Program Synthesis.} Given a set of locations and candidate templates for
those locations, we are trying to solve a problem of synthesis, meaning that we
try to generate code that would match the templateâ€™s GAST and make the program
type-check. For each location, we enumerate all possible expressions, until we
find a small set that makes the program to type-check. We try to use existing
code in our synthesis algorithm, by considering subexpressions of the
expressions we try to replace.

\mypara{Synthesis for Multiple Locations.} Using our error localization
predictions, we get a confidence for each location in the type-error slice.
Previous work has shown that just the top 3 locations from this set can solve up
to 90\% of type-errors. But there are cases where more than one location needs
to be fixed. Therefore, we rank the confidence of the powerset of all locations.
The confidence for a subset of locations can be acquired by the product of each
locationâ€™s confidence in the subset. This holds because we consider each
locationâ€™s probability to be the correct location to be fixed independent from
other locations.



\subsection{Step 5: Generating Feedback}
\label{subsec:step5}

Finally, having generated automatic repairs for a given ill-typed program using
our predictive models and program synthesis, we want to use that to help users
completely fix their programs and understand what the problem was in the
original program. To do so, we want to provide \emph{minimal} repairs to
students, meaning repairs that are as close to their original program but also
catch the programmers intent for that piece of code. Since we have multiple fix
templates to choose from and many candidate locations to fix in a program, maybe
the user would find it most useful to get more than one suggestion, and those
suggestions to be ranked according to some metric.

\mypara{Ranking Fixes.} We rank each solution by two metrics, the
\emph{tree-edit distance} and the \emph{string-edit} distance. Previous work has
used those metrics to consider minimal changes, i.e. changes that are as close
as possible to the original programs, so novice programmers can better
understand feedback. However, different metrics may give betters fixes as we
discuss later. Programmers usually have in mind what the \emph{type signature}
the functions that they write are supposed to have. So, it is reasonable to
provide the option to the user to give the intended type for the program's
functions we are trying to repair. In our case, we acquire the intended types
from the fixed versions of the dataset.

\mypara{Example.} In \autoref{fig:repair} we can see a minimal repair that our
method could return, using the template and error location discussed in
\autoref{subsec:step2} to synthesize this solution. However, this solution is
not the top one that are implementation would give (that would be identical to
the solution the programmer gave), we use this repair to demonstrate different
aspects of the synthesizer. We can see that this solution is very close to the
one that the programmer finally came up with, but still has some holes. This
time, however, there are some indications as to what these holes should be. Here
our synthesizer suggested two different variables should be used to fill those
template holes.
