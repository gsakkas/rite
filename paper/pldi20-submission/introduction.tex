% The problem
%
Languages with Hindley-Milner style, unification based inference 
offer the benefits of static typing with minimal annotation overhead.
The catch, however, is that programmers must first ascend the steep 
learning curve associated with understanding the \emph{error messages} 
produced by the compiler. 
%
While \emph{experts} can, usually, readily decipher the errors, and 
view them as invaluable aids to program development and refactoring,
\emph{novices} are typically left quite befuddled and frustrated, 
without a clear idea of \emph{what} the problem is~\cite{Wand1986-nw}.
%
Owing to the importance of the problem, several authors 
have proposed methods to help debug type errors, typically, 
by \emph{slicing} down the program to the problematic locations~\cite{Haack2003-vc, Rahli2015-tt}, 
by \emph{enumerating} possible causes \cite{Lerner2007-dt, Chen2014-gd},
or \emph{ranking} the possible locations using MAX-SAT 
\cite{Pavlinovic2014-mr}, Bayesian~\cite{Zhang2014-lv} 
or statistical analysis~\cite{Seidel:2017}.
%
While valuable, these approaches at best help localize 
the problem but the student is still left in the dark 
about how to \emph{fix} their code.

% Repairs as error messages?
\mypara{Repairs as Feedback}
%
Several recent papers have proposed an inspiring new line of 
attack on the feedback problem: using techniques from synthesis 
to provide feedback in the form of \emph{repairs} that the student 
can apply to improve their code. 
%
These repairs are found either by symbolically searching a space 
of candidate programs circumscribed by an expert-defined repair 
model \cite{singh2013,HeadGSSFDH17}, or via the observation that 
\emph{similar programs} have similar repairs, \ie by calculating 
``diffs'' from the given solution and a \emph{correct} program 
that is the ``closest'' to the student's solution ~\cite{Gulwani_2018,Wang_2018}

While this approach is compelling for generating feedback in large
classes, it has several crucial requirements that render it inapplicable 
for type error messages.
%
First, for type errors, the space of candidate repairs is massive. 
It is quite unclear whether a small set of repair models \emph{exists} 
or even if it does, what it \emph{looks like}. More importantly, 
to scale, it is essential that we remove the requirement that an 
expert carefully curate some set of candidate repairs.
%
Second, the approach requires a corpus of similar programs, 
whose syntax trees or execution traces can be used to match 
each incorrect program with a ``correct'' version that is 
used to provide feedback. Programs with static type errors 
have no execution traces. 
%
More importantly, we desire a means to generate feedback 
for \emph{new} programs that novices write and, hence 
cannot rely on matching against some (existing) correct 
program.

\mypara{Analytic Program Repair}
%
In this work, we present a novel error repair 
strategy called \emph{Analytic Program Repair} 
that uses supervised learning instead of manually 
crafted repair models or matching against a corpus 
of correct code.
%
Our strategy is based on the key insight that 
\emph{similar errors} have similar repairs.
%
Our strategy realizes the above insight by using 
a training dataset of pairs of ill-typed programs 
and their fixed versions to: 
%
(1)~\emph{learn} a collection of candidate repair templates 
    by abstracting and partitioning the edits made in the 
    training set into a representative set of templates;
%
(2)~\emph{predict} the appropriate template from a given error, 
    by training multi-class classifiers on the repairs templates 
    used in the training set; 
%
(3)~\emph{synthesize} a concrete repair from the template 
   by enumerating and ranking correct (\eg well-typed) 
   terms matching the predicted template, 
%
thereby, generating a fix from a candidate program.
%
Crucially, we show how to perform the crucial abstraction 
from a particular \emph{program} to an abstract \emph{error} 
by representing programs via \emph{bag-of-abstracted-terms} (BOAT) 
\ie as numeric vectors of syntactic and semantic features \cite{Seidel2017-ko}. 
%
This abstraction lets us train predictors over high-level 
code features, \ie to learn correlations between features 
that cause errors and their corresponding repairs, allowing 
the analytic approach to generalize beyond matching against 
existing programs.

\mypara{\toolname}
%
We have implemented our approach in \toolname: a type error reporting 
tool for \ocaml programs. We train (and evaluate) \toolname on a set of 
over 4,500 ill-typed \ocaml programs drawn from two instances of an 
introductory programming course.
%
Given a new ill-typed program, \toolname generates a list of potential 
solutions ranked by likelihood and an \emph{edit-distance} metric. 
We train \toolname on programs from one year and evaluate in several 
ways.
%
First, we measure its \emph{accuracy}: we show that \toolname correctly 
predicts the right repair template {FIXME} times.
%
Second, we measure its \emph{efficiency}: we show that \toolname is able 
to synthesize a concrete repair {FIXME} of the time in XXX seconds.
%
Finally, we measure the \emph{quality} of the generated messages with 
a user study with 29 participants and show that humans and show that 
humans perceive both \toolname's edit locations and final repair quality 
to be better than those produced by \seminal, a state-of-the-art OCaml 
repair tool \cite{Lerner2007} in a statistically-significant manner.

% First, what is a repair and when are two repairs similar?
% Second, what is an error and when are two errors similar?
% Third, how do we automatically match (similar) errors to (similar) repairs?
