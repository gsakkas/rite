% The problem
%
Languages with Hindley-Milner style, unification based inference 
offer the benefits of static typing with minimal annotation overhead.
The catch, however, is that programmers must first ascend the steep 
learning curve associated with understanding the \emph{error messages} 
produced by the compiler. 
%
While \emph{experts} can, usually, readily decipher the errors, and 
view them as invaluable aids to program development and refactoring,
\emph{novices} are typically left quite befuddled and frustrated, 
without a clear idea of \emph{what} the problem is~\cite{Wand1986-nw}.
%
Owing to the importance of the problem, several authors 
have proposed methods to help debug type errors, typically, 
by \emph{slicing} down the program to the problematic locations~\cite{Haack2003-vc, Rahli2015-tt}, 
by \emph{enumerating} possible causes \cite{Lerner2007-dt, Chen2014-gd},
or \emph{ranking} the possible locations using MAX-SAT 
\cite{Pavlinovic2014-mr}, Bayesian~\cite{Zhang2014-lv} 
or statistical analysis~\cite{Seidel:2017}.
%
While valuable, these approaches at best help localize 
the problem but the student is still left in the dark 
about how to \emph{fix} their code.

% Why is this hard

In this paper ... new approach based on REPAIR.

Several recent papers have proposed using techniques from synthesis 
to provide feedback in the form of \emph{repairs} that the student 
can apply to improve their code. These repairs are found either by 
symbolically searching a space of candidate programs circumscribed 
by an expert-defined repair model, or by calculating ``diffs'' from 
the given solution and a \emph{correct} program that is the ``closest'' 
to the student's solution.

- unfortunately doesn't apply in our domain: type errors
    - no repair model
    - no traces (to use to match)
    - no programs to cluster with
        (don't want to restrict to MOOC/classes)

- Key insight: similar errors have similar repairs.
    - what are repairs? 
    - how to know what error is similar to? 

- RITE:
    1. repairs? learn family of repair-templates from student data set (generalizable, fine-grained edits, not whole program)
    2. similar? train multi-labeled classifiers on BOAT; given new program predict location+template
    3. message? enumerative synthesis to fill in template at location using type-checker as oracle. 

- We have implemented and evaluated RITE in several ways.
    1. accuracy
    2. user-study comparison vs. seminal
    3. XXX
