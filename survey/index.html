  Type errors are a common stumbling block for people trying to learn
  functional programming languages like OCaml or Haskell. 

  We are interested in learning what makes type errors difficult to
  diagnose and fix.

  <!-- They are notoriously terse and easily misleading to novices. These -->
  <!-- languages refuse to let programmers run their code until the type -->
  <!-- checker is satisfied. -->

  <!-- We want to study whether running the code and presenting a -->
  <!-- counter-example (a set of inputs that would cause the program to -->
  <!-- crash) can help diagnose and fix type errors. -->
</p>
<p>
  This survey is completely voluntary; you may stop at any time.  We
  will not ask you for your name and will not record any identifying
  information. Data obtained from this survey will only be used to learn
  whether providing runtime traces helps diagnose and fix type errors.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to participate, you will be presented with examples of
  code written by students learning OCaml, and we will ask you to
  identify the error and fix it.
</p>
<p>
  We recommend some familiarity with OCaml or functional programming to
  take this survey.  We expect the survey to take roughly 30 minutes,
  but there is no time limit.
</p>

  You will be shown several snippets of code with type errors. For each
  example, we ask that you determine the cause of the error (i.e. which
  expression is at fault), explain why there is an error, and rewrite
  the code to fix the error.
</p>
<p>
  Each example will come with either a simple error message, or an
  interactive trace of a failed execution. The interactive trace will
  start with just the input expression and the state at which the
  program got stuck (e.g. by trying to add an integer and a string). You
  can step forward or backward from a given expression by clicking on
  the expression and clicking the "Step forward" or "Step backward"
  button. You can also "Jump" (forward or backward) to the closest
  function call, skipping over intermediate steps. 
</p>
<p>
  In each expression, we will highlight the sub-expression where the
  next computation step will occur. 

  For example, in <pre><code>x + y</code></pre> we would
  highlight <code>x</code> because the next step is to
  lookup <code>x</code> in the environment.

  But in <pre><code>1 + 2</code></pre> we would highlight the entire
  expression, as the next step is performing the addition.

  At times, the trace will need to disambiguate a variable by appending a
  <code>|</code> followed by a number, e.g. <code>n</code> may be
  renamed to <code>n|1</code>.

  Finally, you see the environment at any point in the trace by hovering
  over the corresponding expression.
</p>
<p>
  We recommend taking a few minutes to familiarize yourself with a
  <a target="blank" href="demo.html">quick demo</a> of the interactive
  trace before starting the survey.
