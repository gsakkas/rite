Code readability has a significant impact on developer time. Unreadable code is
harder to understand, harder to modify, harder to fix, and easier to get wrong.
However, we do not really understand what makes code more or less readable. With
this survey, we hope to learn what factors impact people's perceptions of code
readability and whether they are different for different languages.
</p><p>
This Code Readability survey is completely voluntary; you may stop at any time.
We will not ask you for your name and will not record any identifying
information. Data obtained from this survey will only be used to learn the
factors that affect the readability of different code examples.
</p><p>
If you choose to participate, you will be presented with examples of code from
real-world programming projects and asked to rate them as readable or
unreadable. You will also be asked to rate your experience with programming and
with the languages in question.
</p><p>
No special experience is necessary to take this survey. Most people will
complete the survey in less than 30 minutes, but there is no time limit.
</p><p>

You will be shown several examples of code from real-world programming projects.
For each example, we ask that you rate the code readability on a scale of 1
(very unreadable) to 5 (very readable). Once you have rated each snippet, you
will be presented with the next one. You can always go back to look at examples
you have already rated by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the page.
</p><p>
Please do not spend too much time on any example. Since this survey is about
readability and not understanding the code, please just look at the example long
enough to form a quick intuition about the readability and move on.
